# HYDRUS-1D

This source code of HYDRUS-1D is modified from the original "(open) source code of the direct computational module of HYDRUS-1D" downloaded from [here](https://www.pc-progress.com/en/Default.aspx?H1D-description#k8). It is released under GPL-3 and their original source code is available in the [pc-progress](https://github.com/clawrim/hydrus-1d/tree/pc-progress) branch. The original source code was converted from DOS to UNIX format using dos2unix.

The original code fails to compile with GNU Fortran, but the [master](https://github.com/clawrim/hydrus-1d) branch includes modifications that allow it to compile successfully.
